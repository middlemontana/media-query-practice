        <p> Media Queries allow us to make our sites <em>responsive</em><div class="">
            We can use media Queries to apply CSS styling only when certain
            conditions apply. For instance, our sites can look different depending 
            on the size of the screen, or <em>viewport</em> a user is viewing
            our content with. We can also change the way our site appears if a user
            is printing our website, or using a screen-reader!
        </p>

    <div class="column">
        <p>Using media Queries and responsive design allows us to ensure that our 
            site looks and works great no matter <em>how</em> the user is viewing it.
        </p> And, as more people use more devices to browse the internet, intergrating 
        media Queries into websites is becoming a common, widespread practice!

        <p> Are you beginning to see the possibilities here? Media Queries are awesome!
